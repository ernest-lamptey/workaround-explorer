## Functionality
- This project categorises average salaries of different IT roles at different companies.

## Comments
- The project has three files in the modules folder that help with the calculation of the averages.
- Formatting the salaries to have the comma's in te right places took me a while but I eventually figured it out wity some online help. Overall I'm very satisfied I completed the project.
